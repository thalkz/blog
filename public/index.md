## About
Welcome to my blog ! My name is Roland and I'm passionate about both design and code. I am mainly working with on tech like [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and I've been starting to learn [Go](https://golang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and others. I will post here about stuff I'm learning about, which means (disclaimer) that I am not an expert in most of the things I'll talk about ;)

Ealy goals of this blog are to make get this blog up & running. The source code will be posted here [on Github](https://github.com/thalkz/blog). I'm building the webserver myself, in Go and by using as few dependencies as possible and by making it as minimalist as possible. The idea came from reading [Ryan Jacobs' blog](https://blog.notryan.com/), as well as the [Designed to Last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) post. I will also try to follow the principles of [The 12 factor app](https://12factor.net/), which I know this blog is still very far from.

I'm also planning on posting about some of my app projects, some of which are available for download like Noxio on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noxio/id1447716702) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolt.noxio&hl=fr), HistoryTime also on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.trebuchet.historytime&hl=en_US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/history-time/id1395820582).
